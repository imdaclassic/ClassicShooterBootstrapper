# Classic's Shooter Bootstrapper🚀

🎮 CSB is a Roblox script created for a 📺 YouTube Video showing how I made this. ✨ Its main purpose is to launch a clean, user-friendly 🖥️ GUI that provides ⚙️ custom configuration for both an 👁️ ESP module and a 🎯 Aimbot module (both designed to be universal). 🚀 From there, you can run your scripts with your own settings, making the overall experience smoother 🧩 and more accessible 🔓.
## Features📲

- Aimbot V3
- ESP
- Universal
- Multi-Config

## Credits📜

- ImDaClassic (Me): Made the entire bootstrapper and IU and features.
- Exunys: Aimbot V3 Module
- SYNX2025: ESP Script

## How to use🎮

Run this script in your executor for roblox:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imdaclassic/ClassicShooterBootstrapper/refs/heads/main/bootstrapper.lua"))()
```
    
After about 1-5 minutes you should see a GUI popup, if not retry, if that also dont work after a few tries, try look at the console for any errors, and try copying the entire code from the bootstrapper.lua
## Why?🐋

This code serves as an example for you, yes you to work on, make your own script kits and bootstrappers, heck even make your own scripts for roblox and make a bootstrapper for that!
